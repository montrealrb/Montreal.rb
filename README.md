## Description

This is the Montreal.rb organization's website. It is still in development stage so you are welcome to contribute.
You can join our [Slack Team](https://montrealrb-slack.herokuapp.com/) if you have any question, need some help to get started or just hang around with friendly people.

Want to contribute? First thing to look at are the Issues with the [priority](https://github.com/montrealrb/Montreal.rb/labels/Priority) label. You can optionnally use [Waffle.io](http://waffle.io/montrealrb/Montreal.rb) to see the development pipeline used to manage the project.

## Requirements

### Runtime

- ruby 2.3.1
- Postgresql 9.3+

## Development Setup

Fork the repository and clone it to your machine. Then change directory to `Montreal.rb`

```bash
$ git clone <your_fork> && cd Montreal.rb
```

### Ruby & Bundler

You should have Ruby version `2.3.1` installed using your prefered Ruby version management tool (or by globally updating your system Ruby)

__Most Popular Ruby Version Managers__

- [rbenv](http://rbenv.org/)
- [rvm](https://rvm.io/)

You should also have [bundler](http://bundler.io/) (minimum `v1.10`) to help with tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed.

### Database

For development, sqlite3 will be used.

### Rails

> You should check out Ruby on Rails' guides if you are not familiar with the framework : http://guides.rubyonrails.org/

#### Setup your Project

```bash
$ bin/setup
```

Once successfully completed, this setup script will:

- install `bundler` for managing your gem dependencies
- install your project's required gems
- create and setup your database
- cleanup logs and temporary files

__Set environment variables__

Omniauth is used to allow users to log in to the site using GitHub or Twitter accounts. To
use the GitHub API or Twitter API, you must set environment variables for the GitHub 'key' and
'secret.' For the Twitter API you will need to set up TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY and TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET environment variables.

You can first obtain this key/secret [through your GitHub account](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

For image hosting Cloudinary is used. This service gives us the ability to host
 images with a heroku app. Sign up for a [free coludinary account](https://cloudinary.com/).

To tweet automatically when content is published, you can register an app on [Twitter](http://apps.twitter.com)
 and set the keys to your environment variables. If you choose not to, don't set the variables and
 the app will simply skip the tweeting feature.

Now you need to set the environment variables on your server. The procedure
will depend on your system.

For development, copy `.env.sample` file to `.env` and fill appropriately the
variables settings.

If using Heroku, you can set the environment variables like this:

```
heroku config:add GITHUB_KEY=your_key GITHUB_SECRET=your_secret \
  CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://your_key:your_secret \
  --app Montreal.rb
```

#### Start your Web Server

You should be ready to start your webserver using:

```bash
$ bin/rails server
```

By default, your application is accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

#### Code Style

Rubocop is used to anaylize and enforce the code style accross all the codebase.
Before opening a new pull request run:

```bash
$ rubocop -a
```

This command will automatically fix the majority of the code style issues and you'll make code-climate happy.

## Testing

RSpec is used to test the application. You can run all the tests using

```bash
$ bin/rspec
```

or you can run a specific test file (example 1), or a single test (example 2, 17 is the line number of your test)

```bash
$ bin/rspec spec/path/to/your/file.rb    # example 1

$ bin/rspec spec/path/to/your/file.rb:17 # example 2
```

You can also use guard to test automatically when you save a file

```bash
$ bundle exec guard
```

__PROTIP:__ install [ctags](http://ctags.sf.net) and guard will automatically generate an index (or tag) file
of language objects found in source files that allows these items to be quickly and easily located by a text editor.

- ex: macos `brew install ctags && sudo mv /usr/bin/ctags /usr/bin/ctags.bak`
- ex: ubuntu `sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags`

## Deploy

This application is automatically deployed to __heroku__ after a successful [Travis CI](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/heroku/) build of the *master* branch.
