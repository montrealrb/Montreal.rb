  post_content: "Programming the next generation web application isn't all about the
    code. It's also about the business: building a clientele, a revenue model, an
    exit strategy. Luckily, we have two excellent people right here in Montreal to
    show us the ropes: [Benjamin Yoskovitz](http://www.instigatorblog.com/) of [StandoutJobs](http://standoutjobs.com/)
    and [Carl Mercier](http://blog.carlmercier.com/) of [Defensio](http://defensio.com/)
    will be in to tell us more about all those things, and you will have your chance
    too: we have time set aside to do a Q&A after the two presenters.\r \r The meeting
    place is as usual, at [Bloom Digital](http://www.adgear.com/) Headquarters: 481
    Viger W. Be there to learn much more on the business-side of things.\n\n"

  post_content: " [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) is one of the fastest-growing
    language/frameworks of all time, and is extremely well-suited to rapid, or agile,
    development practices. Why then, we asked ourselves, is there not a bigger community
    of RoR developers in Montreal? Where are they all? We decided to create Montreal
    on Rails to find out. Montreal on Rails is our invitation to the Montreal Ruby
    on Rails community to come out and play together. And by that we mean, code &
    learn together. With MoR, we want to bring some level of cohesion to the local
    Rails community and provide a fun monthly gathering point where developers can
    come to exchange with one another. There will be laughs, there will be tears (hey
    we can be sensitive - don't judge) and there will be donuts. So if you live in
    (or around Montreal) and are developing in Ruby on Rails (or want to learn) and
    speak either (or both) of our official languages, then you are formally invited
    to come out to our events. The first will be on the 7th of August. All the details
    can be found [here](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/219916/). Hope to see you
    then! The [Karabunga](http://karabunga.com) Team"

  post_content: |-
    So the first ever Montreal on Rails meetup is scheduled to take place on [August 7th](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/219916/), over at a classroom on McGill campus. We're revving our engines in anticipation, and hope you are too. Many of you are probably wondering what the heck we'll discuss at these crazy events. Well, wonder no more, because we'll be providing a short preview ahead of each meeting. August's inaugural MoR meeting gets things off the ground right with two cool talks from a couple of local Ruby on Rails veterans:

    - [Marc-André Cournoyer](http://macournoyer.wordpress.com/) (of [StandoutJobs](http://www.standoutjobs.com/) fame) will be showing us how to make testing with external services "super fast and fun".
    - [Carl Mercier](http://blog.carlmercier.com/) (from here at [Karabunga](http://www.karabunga.com) HQ) will be talking about [HAML](http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/).
    As always, please do come armed with your very own Rails questions, because we'll be aiming to have an open-forum Q&A session once the talks wrap up. Looking forward to seeing y'all soon; we can barely contain our excitement. Literally.

- post_title: Come Early! (and other administrative stuff)
  post_content: |+
    We're really encouraged to see all the interest that Montreal on Rails has created! As we get close to finalizing the planning for the first event, we're enjoying getting to know McGill's administration machine. We'd like to stress that people come early as the doors to the building will lock tight at 7:00PM (and this is not just a scare tactic - this will be enforced by McGill). Let me reiterate: you will not be able to enter the building after 7PM. To this end, we're **moving up the event start time to 6:30 PM** , and we'll use the first 1/2 hour as an informal chit-chat/donut-eating period in which we can hang out together before the first presentation begins at 7 o'clock sharp. Sound good? Also, if you plan to come please ensure that you use our Upcoming.org [RSVP](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/219916/) page to signal your presence. We have a hard cap on the room capacity, so this is important. Finally, while the presenters will have access to a McGill guest WiFi account for demo purposes, there will not be public Internet access in the room. If you're brave, you can live blog it from your cellphone though ;) I think that's everything. Enjoy the next couple weeks, and see you on the 7th!

    Well, I didn't imagine this would happen but we've hit our maximum room capacity (35) for our first MoR meeting. All this interest is a great sign for the Montreal community! This means that if you've put your name on the Upcoming.org "Attending" list you have nothing to worry about. Conversely, if you've not RSVP'ed by now, then you're probably out of luck -- unless registered attendees bail, so you may want to keep an eye on the [event](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/219916/). Thanks again to all of you that have signed up! Until the 7th, stay fit and have fun.

  post_content: |-
    So, that was fun! I think it's fair to say that our inaugural event was a modestly big success. Thanks to all of you who came out and participated in the evening. Thanks especially to [Marc-André](http://macournoyer.wordpress.com/) and [Carl](http://blog.carlmercier.com/) who gave sweet presentations. Big ups to you guys. **An administrative request:** If you came out this evening, please drop a comment on this post with: 1) Your thoughts + suggestions. 2) Your contact information (if you'd like to share it for networking purposes). We may roll this info up into a "Local RoR Devs Contact Page" on this blog. Is that a good idea? Some thoughts from my end:

    - The room is probably not ideal - I'd like to explore options to find us a bigger space, and one where donut consumption may not be met with such scorn ;) Some people have mentioned the ETS, if anyone else has other suggestions or contacts, please let me know. (I think we'll have to do it at the same venue for September, because we won't have time to organize something properly before then. I'm shooting to have something better lined up for the October event)
    - Upcoming.org was suggested to be too onerous. How big of a problem is this? We'll consider a wiki, or other options, but want to make sure it's a sufficiently big issue to warrant the effort. For now, I'll just set up a new Upcoming page and if it's a big deal we'll switch to a more flexible option. (Upcoming sent me a free tshirt so I'm a fan... what can I say, my love is cheap).
    - I'm not sure if the "discussion forum" after the presentations really worked. Should we try again? Have people submit questions in advance? Maybe try a different angle?
    Thanks again for kicking off MoR on such an enthusiastic note. Look forward to seeing you next month!

  post_content: |+
    First off, the next Montreal on Rails meeting will be on Tuesday, September 4th. Mark your calendars and go [RSVP](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/235952/)now. Note that we've moved the start time to 6:45 PM. Despite some holidays and out-of-town-ness the planning effort for this next meeting is now in full swing. We've had some tepid interest from potential presenters, but we do not yet have 2 confirmed speakers on deck for the September meetup. **This means,**  **you should give a talk!** It's easy. You love Rails, and so will everyone else in the room. All you have to do is share your little domain of expertise, and if don't have a particular domain of expertise, that's OK, because we're always looking for presentations appropriate for a beginner audience as well. If you're interested in speaking on any RoR-related topic, do shoot us an [email](mailto:info@karabunga.com). An administrative note, we'll be running this meeting in the same McGill classroom again. We'll see what the turnout is like, and make a decision about future space options. We've investigated some other possibilities, which we'll bring up for discussion.

    Alrighty then! Fred Ngo has kindly confirmed for us that [StandoutJobs](http://www.standoutjobs.com) will be hosting the next (and future!) MontrealOnRails event(s) at their shiny new offices at [3981 boul.

Well done Fred and thanks for the generous offer. On to administrative details for the event: **Speakers** _This one is going to big._ We have two seasoned RoR gurus that have stepped up to the plate. - Gary Haran will be talking on Javascript with [Prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/), in what promises to be an interesting follow-up to Chris' EXT presentation last month. - François Beausoleil is coming all the way from Sherbrooke to present his _very own_ [Piston](http://piston.rubyforge.org/index.html) utility. - James Golick will present 2 great plugins: [make\_resourceful](http://jamesgolick.com/2007/8/6/super-dry-resources) and [shoulda](http://thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda). **Other Stuff** As usual, please [RSVP](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/264343/) using the much-loved Upcoming.org service. Note that the start time will be 6:30PM. Please be on time. Also, we're upping the attendance ceiling to 40 ppl, reflecting our new, bigger digs. We're planning to have a pizza break between the two talks; so if you're interested, bring a few bucks to get in on the action. We'll be providing pop -- I'm taking suggestions in the comments, but Tahiti Treat is out of the question (bad TT trip in 1st year uni...) See y'all in a few weeks.

    Yesterday was Montreal on Rails #3 and god, it was good! Our presenters, [Gary Haran](http://garyharan.com), [François Beausoleil](http://blog.teksol.info/) and [James Golick](http://jamesgolick.com/) all gave very insightful and interesting presentations. If you want more information about these, I have posted more information on the [past presentations](http://www.montrealonrails.com/past-presentations) page. [Alain Pilon](http://www.workingwithrails.com/person/8560-alain-pilon) took great pictures of the event has already posted them on Flickr. James Golick and François Beausoleil both videotaped the presentations so we can (hopefully) expect multi-angle videos shortly. See the [Pics & Vids](http://www.montrealonrails.com/pictures) page. Many people went out for a beer(s) afterward (to wash down that Domino's Pizza!) and, as always, I had interesting conversations with [Mathieu Martin](http://webmat.wordpress.com/) and [Marc-André Cournoyer](http://macournoyer.wordpress.com/). Apparently, a few of you don't know we have a [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/montreal-on-rails/topics). Well, we do! Feel free to subscribe to it and post your burning questions. Special thanks to [Standout Jobs](http://standoutjobs.com) for hosting the event. The new venue is fantastic! A big thank you to [O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/) for sponsoring the event with free books! We at [Karabunga](http://karabunga.co) never thought MoR would be such a success, so most and foremost, thanks to YOU!

    With three successful events under our belt, we're now getting ready for our fourth! [StandoutJobs](http://www.standoutjobs.com)' offices were such a pleasant venue that I think we'll keep coming back - I don't expect there will be much love lost for our old, anti-food-consumption, puppy-hating, pain-inducing McGill digs ;) As usual, we have an amazing line-up of speakers (uhh..) lined-up:

    - [Mathieu Martin](http://webmat.wordpress.com/) will present JRuby, a 100% Java implementation of Ruby;
    - Alain Pilon will dish the goods on acts\_as\_state\_machine;
    - [Sylvain Carle](http://www.afroginthevalley.com/), and his team from incandescently-hot startup [Praized](http://www.praized.com), will talk about [Comatose](http://comatose.rubyforge.org/) and its integration inside an existing RoR app.
    If you plan to attend, please RSVP [here](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/291353/) while there's still room. If you come, please kindly be on time (yes, I'm looking at you [Heri](http://ww.montrealtechwatch.com)). Like last month, we'll have free pop on hand and order pizza for the hungry, so bring $5 if you would like to partake in Domino goodness. Also, bring a few extra bucks because we'll be passing around a collection plate to help defray the costs of the chairs/equipment that [Fred](http://siliconisland.ca/) kindly picked up for the group. Look forward to seeing y'all in a couple weeks.

  post_content: |+
    We'll be a capacity crowd (yet again) at Montreal on Rails tonight at [StandoutJobs](http://www.standoutjobs.com)' offices on St-Laurent. And good news: they have a buzzer now, so you won't be locked out! Like last time we'll be raffling off a couple of books (generously provided by [O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/)) and there may even be some kind of special announcement (ah, the suspense!) Don't forget to bring a few bux for pizza and/or contributing to the MoR equipment fund. See you in 2.75 hours.

  post_content: |-
    It was great to see familiar faces on Tuesday night -- it's starting to feel like there really is a tight RoR community here in town, and that's exactly the point of these events. Many thanks to the evening's speakers!

    - [Mathieu Martin](http://webmat.wordpress.com/2007/11/08/follow-up-on-my-presentation-on-jruby/), an up-and-coming RoR star, provided an in depth look into JRuby, something a lot of devs were clearly interested in, but few had played around with.
    - Alain Pilon, who is a business analyst by day and coder by night, talked about [acts\_as\_state\_machine](http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/acts_as_state_machine), a plug-in that appears very useful for a wide range of applications.
    - [Sylvain Carle](http://www.afroginthevalley.com/), local tech legend, provided an overview of how his new company [Praized](http://www.praized.com) used Comatose in a multi-lingual setting.
    So, all in all, another really great evening of information, pizza and fun! Now a couple of administrative notes: - If you RSVP on the Upcoming.org page, please either: COME or take your name OFF the list. This month, we were at capacity on the Upcoming page, but only had about an 80% attendance rate... that's not great. So please be better about that. - Our goal is to have two 30-45 minute presentations and one 10-15 minute presentation, per event. We're going to try to police the time constraints a little bit more militantly tightly (by calling out a 5 minute warning?) so that the evening wraps up in a reasonable amount of time. - We're looking for two speakers for next month's (Dec 4th) meeting - one short, one long talk. [Shoot](mailto://info@karabunga.com) us an email if you're interested. See ya next month!

    Hola! Our next event will take place on December 4 at Standout Jobs, as now usual. Here are the confirmed presentations so far:

    - [Carl Mercier](http://blog.carlmercier.com): Where to deploy your Rails application? An overview of shared hosting, VPS and Amazon EC2.
    - [Mehdi Adda](http://www2.lifl.fr/~adda/): Putting the pieces together: how to setup the ultimate Rails box.

    Just a quick reminder, MoR5 is next Tuesday at [Standout Jobs](http://standoutjobs.com). If you wish to attend, please [RSVP at Upcoming.org](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/315270/). We had a few no-shows in the past. We ask you to **please** remove your name from the RSVP list if you can't make it. Be nice and leave your spot to somebody else... we're always sold out! This month, we're going to focus on the deployment of your incredible world-changing, Facebook killer, Microsoft exterminator Rails app. Our 2 presentations will be:

    - [Carl Mercier](http://blog.carlmercier.com/) (that's me!): Where to deploy your Rails application on the cheap? An overview of shared hosting, VPS and Amazon EC2.
    - [Mehdi Adda](http://www2.lifl.fr/~adda/): Putting the pieces together: how to setup the ultimate Rails box.
    As it is now the tradition, we'll have pizza and soda to feed the hungry. If you wish to partake, please bring **7$** to cover the expenses. Yes, that's 2$ higher than usual: 5$ was unfortunately not enough to cover the costs and we had to pay it out of our own pocket. But as Rails developers charging hundreds per hour, I guess it shouldn't affect you too much... Will it? ;-) See you on Tuesday, cheers!

    (I'll be brief, my bed is waiting) Thanks to everybody for coming out tonight! Special thanks to our presenters, Luc and Jean-François. If you're interested in GIT, you definitely need to watch the [Peepcode video](http://peepcode.com/products/git). They gave us a lot of freebies, so please encourage them; they make awesome videos. (really!) You also want to read [this article on J-F's blog](http://jfcouture.com/2007/12/18/various-tips-for-setting-up-git-improve-gitk-look-and-get-bash-completion/). It'll show you how to put the branch name in your shell prompt. (that alone was worth coming to MoR tonight in my opinion) As I mentioned tonight, I want to hear your comments on how to make MoR better, so [I started this thread on the Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/montreal-on-rails/browse_thread/thread/9744882a8152edbc). Please send your ideas. I care, really. I figure we were a bit short on pizza tonight. I'm sorry about that, I'll try to do better next time. It's hard to gauge how hungry you are! I also noticed that a lot of people didn't RSVP. PLEASE do in the future. Finally, we need 2 presenters for next month. Please send me your topic at carl at karabunga dot com. Oh... and here's what beer does to your brain ;-) : [![Beer can definitely affect your behaviors](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2040/2196102527_5be4506288.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cmercier/2196102527/ "Beer can definitely affect your behaviors by cmercier79, on Flickr")See you next time: February the 19.

I'm willing to try this out. If you're interested in doing a 10 minutes max presentation, send me an email and I'll add you to the list. (we now have our man!) Due to time constraints (and people having a life outside of coding), we'll only have 1 short presentation this month.

- post_title: Refactoring MoR + month off
  post_content: |-
    Hola! First of all, thanks to our presenters from our last meet-up. I had to leave early and didn't see them, but I heard good things. Congrats! I'll be in California for most of April and I thought... I can either ask someone to organize the next meeting, or take a month off. I asked a few buddies what they thought and came to the conclusion that we should just take a little break and hold the next meeting in May. Last month's attendance was a little lower than usual; I think some people are getting a little bit tired of the format. I know I am. In my opinion, Mor is starting to get a little to repetitive and we don't have enough time to chit-chat. I asked around and people seem to be most interested in:

    - less presentation
    - more schmoozing
    - more boozing
    - less Domino's
    I suggest we turn the whole thing around and change the format. In order to do it right, **I need your feedback**. Tell me what you like/hate about MoR and we'll fix it. Here's what I suggest:
    - 1 "long" talk, as we know it (30-40 mins)
    - 2 "short" talk, 5-15 mins max
    - then we all go eat/drink somewhere. (no more Domino's, please!)
    Unless you're totally offended by taking a month off, our next meeting will be on May 20. Please comment with for your feedback! Thoughts? Ideas? Complains?

    After a little break, MoR is coming back! The next event will be held on May 20. Wanna come? Please [RSVP](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/609657/). This month, we're trying a different format: less talk, more booze (this could be dangerous). We'll start with a presentation by Francois Beausoleil entitled "Refactoring to Patterns: How Mephisto went from a single engine Lada to a multi-engine jet fighter". Francois said he'll need a few volunteers to help out. Then, instead of the usual pizza and more talks, we'll all go grab a bite and drink a cold one somewhere. This is your chance to talk Ruby with other nerds. So the question is, where should we go eat? I don't know Montreal very well so I need your help on this one. Please comment with your suggestions. cheers!

    Thanks to Francois for presenting last night! It was awesome, especially the part about [Defensio](http://defensio.com) \<g\>! (hey! gotta crank up my Google juice one way or another!) I decided to NOT pursue a career in Hollywood. My acting performance was rather poor, so I won't try to go after Brad Pitt's lunch.

I need your help (yes, you!)...

    1. What did you think of the new format? Should we scrap it, improve it?
    2. Should we take a break for the summer?
    3. We need presenters. You don't need to be an expert to present, and it's a lot of fun!

    Montreal. Let's unite against this thing called Ruby on Rails. It has been making our life way too easy. Let's get out of our comfort zones and explore new things! This coming September 16, we're completely changing the format of Montreal on Rails. Actually, it'll be anything BUT about Rails. Let's call it Montreal Against Rails. First of all, I have a big surprise for you all. Straight from this lil' country called the USA, James Robertson will introduce our Ruby heads to Seaside, a web framework for Smalltalk which is gaining a lot of momentum. Second, our very own Marc-André Cournoyer will talk about [rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/)s. Nice Racks that is. (currently considering changing the venue to Paré for the occasion) Thirdly, I'll quickly introduce you to another Ruby framework: [Merb](http://merbivore.com/). It is considered to be the #1 alternative to Rails by many. I'll go over the pros and cons and explain why [we](http://defensio.com) [switched to Merb](http://blog.defensio.com/2008/07/10/major-upgrade-coming/) (from Rails). I'll also tell you why you should (or should not) switch too. Please join me and rebel against Rails! September 16! PS: In case you didn't get the joke, we still love Rails, don't worry :) But the event is NOT a joke!

- post_title: MoR =&gt; open_source_hackfest?
  post_content: "(This post is written by [James Golick](http://jamesgolick.com))\n\nOver
    the last year or so, I've really enjoyed Montreal on Rails. There have been lots
    of awesome presentations, and general good times had by all. \n\nWhen Carl asked
    for feedback on Uservoice, a lot of people seemed interested in more presentations
    geared towards newbies. While presentations can be really interesting and useful,
    most of the best programmers I know learned their craft through open source work.
    There's no better way to improve your skills (not to mention your profile in the
    industry).\n\n \n\nSo, I've been thinking about organizing a monthly, open source
    hackfest. It would be an informal evening where people could come and work on
    FLOSS. If you have a project, it would be a great place to get help from some
    of your local ruby gurus, or just an excuse to work on your project. If not, it'd
    be a great place to pick up a project and learn from other developers. At the
    end of every evening, we could have a few lightning talks (5mins), to give people
    the opportunity to show off what they've been working on. Or not, if nobody wants
    to speak. Only rule: no preparation allowed. No slides. Nothing. Think of it sort
    of like Zed Shaw's [Freehacker's Union](http://freehackersunion.org/joining.html),
    minus the hazing ritual for new members. So, what do you think? If we turned MoR
    in to an open source hack fest for a couple of months, would you miss the presentations?
    Is this something you're interested in trying out? Will you be offended if we
    open it up to all things Ruby, instead of just rails? \n\n"

    Hello! Yesterday sure was PACKED at MoR 13! Thanks to everybody for showing up, and most importantly to Jennifer and Rob for presenting. The presentations were very insightful. As I mentioned last night, I decided to step down from my role at MoR and I will no longer be organizing the monthly events. It's been a lot of fun but I felt the time had come for someone else to take over. Some new blood can't hurt after roughly 1.5 year. From now on, [James Golick](http://jamesgolick.com), a very experienced Ruby hacker will take the lead. James has great ideas for the group which he'll announce shortly. It was important for me to pick someone who will take the group to new heights, and I truly believe James to be that guy. As for myself, I'll definitely make sure to participate in the upcoming meetings and I'll be glad to assist James as much as he wants me to. It's been fun meeting you all and I look forward to next meeting! Carl

- post_title: Montreal.rb
  post_content: |+
    Before I say anything else, I wanted to take a moment to thank Carl for all the amazing work he put in to Montreal on Rails. Bringing the Montreal rails community together was a major accomplishment. Thanks, Carl!

    On to business. When Carl asked me whether I was interested in taking over MoR, I was pretty excited, because I had been planning to start my own, independent hackfest night. With an awesome existing community and a great venue, I'd be a lot better off.

    Well, after [asking](http://www.montrealonrails.com/2008/11/04/mor-open_source_hackfest/) the community, it seems pretty clear that there's interest in the concept. There's only one problem, though — being tied to rails.

    So, as my first official order of business, I am renaming Montreal on Rails to Montreal.rb (hash tag [#montrealrb](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23montrealrb)). I own the domain name, but don't yet have a logo. If anybody would like to contribute one, that would certainly be appreciated. If not, we'll come up with something.

    The next meeting and inagural Montreal.rb will take place on December 16th. **It will be a hackfest.** So, fire up your githubs, and let's get to hacking. Wheter you're a veteran FLOSS hacker or a ruby newbie, come out, have fun and hack with us!

    Finally, I wanted to leave you with the links to the **many** projects that have come out of [Seattle.rb](http://www.zenspider.com/Languages/Ruby/Seattle/Projects.html) and [Boston.rb](http://bostonrb.org/projects). I hope they'll inspire you as much as they inspire me.

- post_title: This Month&#039;s Meeting - Back to Presentations
  post_content: |+
    Last month's hack fest was a lot of fun, but somewhat sparsely attended. It has come to my attention, too, that some people were put off by the new format. So, let's try something different this month.

    We're going to have one event this month with a similar format to the one we've been used to for the last year or so. We'll have a couple of presentations, and then go for drinks. Hopefully, this will give people the opportunity to come out, and hang out with local rubyists, without the added pressure of needing an open source project to hack on.

    So, **we need speakers for this month**. Even if you're only interested in giving a short talk, we'd love to have you come out and speak at this event. Please send me an email at my first name at giraffesoft dot ca if you're interested in speaking.

    Today's second announcement is that we have a new home for Montreal.rb! The awesome guys at [Bloom](http://bloomdigital.com) have been nice enough to offer up their offices as a new space for the group to meet. See the [upcoming event](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1481597/) for details.

    Oh, and don't forget to RSVP, please.

Upcoming isn't working for me. So, I guess there's no RSVP'ing this month.

    Our first speaker this month will be Chris Scott. Here's the abstract:

    > As an application grows, one sometimes finds their server-side communication becoming distributed throughout the client code, making it difficult to maintain fine-grained control over who gets to see which stuff and execute what upon it. Ext.Direct is a technology which allows you to marshal your Ext communication layer into a discrete, server-side-agnostic, well-engineered package.

    We're looking for at least one more speaker for this month. So, please, if you're interested in giving a talk, however short, get in touch with me (james at giraffesoft ca).

Please [RSVP at upcoming](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2525176/?ps=5).

    At last month's meeting, a lot of people told me that they'd be more inclined to speak if they could give a shorter talk. So, this month, we're going to try short talks.

    If you're interested in giving a talk of between one and fifteen minutes, please get in touch with me (jamesgolick at google's webmail app). We're open to anything. So, don't be shy!

    [Tonight's Montreal.rb](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2525176/) is sure to be a good one.

    We've got [Mat Martin](http://programblings.com) of [Smart Hippo](http://www.smarthippo.com/) talking about "Working with git". Mat's going to show us how to take better advantage of git's (awesome) power.

    Then, we have [Martin Aumont](http://mynyml.com/) (not from Smart Hippo) talking about [Enumerable#every](http://github.com/mynyml/every/tree/master), Symbol#to\_proc's hot cousin.

    We've also got [Martin Carel](http://dev-logger.blogspot.com/), also of [Smart Hippo](http://www.smarthippo.com/), speaking about git log. His summary: "Owning a project’s git history with "git log" and friends. Live demo lightning talk."

    Finally, [Sean Braithwaite](http://d474.net/), also from [Smart Hippo](http://www.smarthippo.com/) (maybe they're carpooling or something?), is going to be talking about DataMapper. I'm really excited about this one, because DataMapper is awesome. Here's Sean's description of the talk:

    > Datamapper is an ruby (MRI, YARV, JRuby) Object Relational Mapper (ORM) comparable to Sequel or ActiveRecord. Unlike it's comparables, datamapper is becoming increasingly data store agnostic. Not only can it be used to avoid writing sql, but is aiming to define a general language for object storage. This talk aims to present the recent developments in dm-core/next branch and what these changes have to offer developers working with multiple non relational data stores.

    Sadly, this is going to be my last Montreal.rb. I'm leaving Montreal at the end of June to eventually end up in Vancouver. My good friend and colleague [Daniel Haran](http://danielharan.com) is going to be taking over Montreal.rb.

    I'm really excited about this month's meeting, though. We've got 3 amazing speakers lined up.

    [Loren Segal](http://gnuu.org/) is going to be talking about the work he's been doing with [yard](http://yard.soen.ca/), an (awesome) RDoc competitor he wrote.

    [Brian Cardarella](http://cardarella.blogspot.com/) is coming up from Boston to give a talk called "Debugging Out". In it, Brian will talk about speeding up your debugging time with ruby-debug.

    Finally, we'll have [Pat Allan](http://freelancing-gods.com/), author of [thinking-sphinx](http://freelancing-god.github.com/ts/en/) and ruby hero, all the way from Melbourne, Australia. He hasn't decided what he's going to talk about yet. But, you can be sure it'll be aewsome.

    Start 2010 with a Ruby refresher: Marc-André Lafortune will give us a talk on Hash. Like his last presentation on super, I expect this will be ideal for beginners while surprising experts with some edge cases. [Jonathan Palardy](http://technotales.wordpress.com/) will present [Resque](http://github.com/defunkt/resque), Redis-backed library for creating background jobs, placing those jobs on multiple queues, and processing them later. As always, the meetings start around 6:30pm at Bloom Digital's offices: 481 Avenue Viger West, Suite 202 Montréal, Québec H2Z 1G6

    Before Gary's talk yesterday, Sean Braithwaite showed us a great new logo:

    [![](http://teksol.s3.amazonaws.com/montreal-rb.png "Montreal.rb Logo")](http://teksol.s3.amazonaws.com/montreal-rb.png)

    With this logo, and Gary's talk, we suddenly find ourselves ready to generate lots of new content. To this end, I propose we have a Hacknight on March 4th, at 6:30 PM where we will dissect and extend one gem we, as a group, will choose. We have lots of great candidates. The format I want to explore is as a group we concentrate on a single project. We have received permission to use Bloom's offices again, so we have access to the big screen for coding. Essentially, I'm proposing a big pairing session, with 10-12 heads instead of 2. If you're interested, [please RSVP](http://montrealrb.wufoo.com/forms/mtlrb-hacknight-20100304/).

    about [Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/) in the context of [Resque](http://github.com/defunkt/resque),

    [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/), [TokyoCabinet](http://1978th.net/tokyocabinet/)
    and many others\n\r Any of those topics is a candidate for a talk. You don't have

    that's not a Rubyist to present about their language. If you want to talk about
    your language, please reach me at [francois@teksol.info](mailto:francois@teksol.info?subject=I'd+like+to+present).

    posted the slides to his talk on Slideshare: [Clojure for Rubyists](http://www.slideshare.net/jfheon/clojure-forrubyists).
    Cyril Robert didn't have slides, but you can start with [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/)'s
    home page.\r \r [Hugo Frappier](http://hugofrappier.wordpress.com/) announced
    a Rails training session at the CRIM. More information on the [Ruby on Rails -

  post_content: "It was a great meeting. We had [Adrian Dafinei](http://ca.linkedin.com/in/nerdsalliance)
    talk to us about the Association Québécoise des Informaticiennes et Informaticiens
    Indépendants. Their website is [www.aqii.org](http://www.aqiii.org/).\r \r I also
    proposed a new format for the meetings. We'll keep the 2 presentation format,
    but I'm adding a couple of thing. The new schedule will be the following:\n\n1.
    We'll start with the Book Club: bring one or more books you want to share with
    the rest of the group. Register your book at [bookcrossing.com](http://www.bookcrossing.com/).
    Leave it on the table when you come in. I'll ask volunteers to talk about their
    books: just a couple of minutes - what did you like about your book, why you bought
    it and so on. [Email me](mailto:francois@teksol.info?subject=I'll%20bring%20a%20book)
    what book you'll bring so I know roughly how many books will be on the table.\n2.
    Every 2 or 3 meetings, we'll add the Gem Club: what gems did you recently use,
    how did your integration go, any caveats you want to mention. There's a gem club
    in February. [Tell me](mailto:francois@teksol.info?subject=I%20want%20to%20talk%20at%20the%20Gem%20Club)
    if you want to talk about your gems.\n3. After that we'll have the regular one
    or two presentations, keeping essentially the same format - 10 to 15 minutes per
    presenter. I'll have a monthly theme: be prepared.\n4. Any general public announcements
    would go here.\n5. Finally, if you are looking for a contractor / intern / employee
    / employer / client, now's the time to talk about it. Bring your business cards
    to exchange with other people. Send me your information so I can post it here
    as well.\n\r Don't forget to bring your friends: we were 32 yesterday evening.
    We had one of the bigger rooms at the CRIM. Great venue. The more friends, the
    merrier it'll be, and having more people exposed to Ruby spreads the knowledge
    around!\r \r Just to give you an idea, here are the people who were looking for
    a contractor / intern / employee yesterday night:\r\n- [Bandzoogle](http://bandzoogle.com/)
    was looking for both interns and a full-time employee, their hiring announcement
    is [Bandzoogle is hiring !](http://bandzoogle.com/blog/blogposts/bandzoogle-is-hiring--20540.cfm);\n-
    Hugo Frappier was looking for someone to pair with him on a business plan;\n-
    Code Génome was also looking for someone.\n\r There were more, and I'll add them
    to the list as the information trickles in. Follow us on Twitter as [@montrealrb](http://twitter.com/#!/montrealrb).\r
    \r Thanks again for coming, and see you next February 15<sup>th</sup> for Database
    Month. I'm still looking for 2 presenters: tell me if you want to present.\r \r

- post_title: Database Month Coming Up!
  post_content: "Database Month is coming right up (February 15<sup>th</sup>). I asked
    for 2 volunteers to present on any database topics. Ideas include:\n\n- The pg
    gem - how to use it directly, instead of through [ActiveRecord](http://rubyonrails.org/)\n-
    What about the asynchronous gems? There was a big hoopla about [mysql2](https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2)
    [a while back](http://www.mikeperham.com/2010/04/03/introducing-phat-an-asynchronous-rails-app/).
    Is this still alive? Is it any faster?\n- Benchmark the different NoSQL databases
    (we can pick apart your testing methodology at the after hours!)\n- What's happening
    with [DataMapper](http://datamapper.org/)? Is it any easier than it was? Contrast
    with ActiveRecord for bonus points\n- What about database theory? Can you map
    this [universal organization/person](http://www.tdan.com/view-articles/5014/)
    schema to SQL tables?\n- Constraints in an ActiveRecord world: where are they?\n-
    Using Ruby to write stored procedures\n- What is [MVCC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control)
    and how does it help us?\n- Contrast, compare and benchmark [Redis](http://redis.io/)
    against [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) and [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/),
    using all three as plain key/value stores\n- Deconstruct [ACID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)
    and compare how the different NoSQL databases make tradeoffs\n\r As you can see,
    there are tons of topics you may choose. Remember: no Montreal.rb speakers was
    ever tarred and/or feathered out of the room. If you've never spoken about a technical
    topic before, now's the time to do so. It's good experience and allows you to
    be better known by the community.\r \r Send your talk submissions to [francois@teksol.info](mailto:francois@teksol.info?subject=I%20want%20to%20present)."

  post_content: "Wow! What great attendance tonight! I didn't count, but I believe
    we had over 40 people tonight, including many new faces. I really enjoyed doing
    the exercise with you, and the people I spoke with were happy with the format,
    even if it was a bit fast.\r \r To recap: our mission was to build an application
    where people would register for events: simple in idea, complex in execution.
    Some gems I used:\n\n- Rails (d'oh!)\n- Capybara\n- Steak\n- RSpec\n\r Of course,
    the full gem manifest is available in the repository's [Gemfile](https://github.com/francois/upcoming/blob/master/Gemfile).\r
    \r I think we made good progress. We haven't done any <abbr title=\"user interface\">UI</abbr>
    work, but that's something an enterprising people can fix in an evening. If you
    enjoyed the evening, send me your [GitHub](http://github.com/) username and I'll
    give you commit rights. Then you can code away at will!\r \r The book club was
    also a blast: we had 5 books to exchange tonight. That was great news for me.
    We had books by [Steve Krug](http://www.sensible.com/), [Russ Olssen](http://www.rubyinside.com/a-review-of-eloquent-ruby-by-russ-olsen-it-rocks-4432.html)
    and [Noel Rappin](http://railsrx.com/).\r \r Do you remember the survey to see
    if we move or not? Well, we are: the [Notman House](http://notman.org/) will be
    our venue starting on the May 17<sup>th</sup> meeting. The Notman House is a shared
    co-working space with a venue for hosting meetups, such as ours. [Sylvain Carle](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sylvaincarle)
    was very happy to have us move to the Notman House. Please change your address
    books: we're moving to [Sherbrooke and Clark](http://notman.org/en/contact).\r
    \r In other news, I'm announcing the end of my tenure as the Montreal.rb organizer.
    I would like someone to volunteer to become the next organizer. Your tasks and
    responsibilities, should you choose to accept them, will be:\r\n1. To reserve
    a venue once per month;\n2. Find topics of interest and presenters to do them;\n3.
    Announce (through the blog and ad system) meetings and RSVP links;\n4. Keep the
    community informed of relevant news and topics through the blog;\n5. Present a
    cohesive community to the world.\n\r I will resign just before our July and August
    break. I had a great time as the Montreal.rb organizer, and count myself lucky
    to have had such great speakers and technologies to talk about with all of you."

  post_content: "I'm a bit late in posting this, but I received a notification from
    [Julia Stowell](http://www.linkedin.com/in/juliastowell) about a Microsoft competition:\n\n>
    [Code Your Art Out](http://www.webnotwar.ca/competition/) is a wicked coding competition.
    Any kind of app can be submitted. Application submissions will be judged on Interoperability,
    Creativity and Usability. First prize is $10,000! Second prize is $5,000! And,
    if you want to be eligible for the bonus prize of $5,000 you create an [app for
    a non-profit](http://www.techsoupcanada.ca/microsoft/contest/fpyn). This is your
    chance to shine!\r \r The competition is hosted by Microsoft and kicked off March
    1<sup>st</sup>. Application submissions are due June 1st. The top two finalists
    will be announced on June 10th and will compete for first and second place on
    the evening of June 24th in downtown Toronto. If you develop a killer app and
    are not a finalist, you’ll still be able to present at the main event, and you’ll
    be featured on various Microsoft websites. Basically you’ll still get props if
    you put in the time to create something awesome.\r That looks similar to our Rails
    Rumble, but with a lot more time to code your app. Will you compete?"

Help us create the biggest web conference in Montreal with a great Ruby track. This year, you can also [vote](http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/rate) for the talks you find the most interesting. If you want to help more, I search someone to help me organize the Ruby track of the event.> Starting of September, I'll try to have sponsors for our events. I'm searching companies that would be interested in buying a second round of beer at the Benelux and would like to help us create t-shirt for Montreal.rb. It's a great way to find employees and make your company known by the Ruby community in Montreal. If you know any company that would be interested, put me in contact with them.

    first event is organized by François Beausoleil at Notman House on February 2nd.
    Yes, your last president of Montreal.rb is inviting for an afternoon of Scala
    with Actors for Twitter analytic and a workshop evening of complex SQL queries.
    Being good in SQL, is always useful for any Rails developer. Both these events
    are free and you need to register ( [Scala](http://www.eventbrite.ca/event/2803777173),
    [SQL](http://www.eventbrite.ca/event/2806810245)). For more information, see [François'
    blog post](http://blog.teksol.info/2012/01/18/announcing-scala-and-sql-event-on-february-2nd-in-montreal.html).>
    The next event is [The Cloud Robotics Hackathon](http://roboticshackathon.com/)
    ( [register here](http://roboticshackathon.eventbrite.com/)). It will take place
    at the Notman House from March 2nd to March 4th. I'd really like to see a Ruby
    team participating to that event. If you are interested, you can [contact me](mailto:mprovencher86@gmail.com),
    I'll try to build the team.\r \r \r \r The Cloud Robotics Hackathon aims to catalyse
    the creative process and bring roboticists, programmers, and hackers to produce
    social robotic applications that use collaboration between machines through cloud-computing,
    and natural interaction with humans in order to reach useful goals. The mains
    instance of the Hackathon will be held in Montreal, and teams around the world
    are invited to hack as well at on the same day under the same rules. By encouraging
    makers and hackers to embrace the technologies of the future (being cloud computing
    and robotics) we ensure that today’s creative minds will be prepared for tomorrow’s
    challenges. Hackers are invited to let their imagination go wild and come up with
    their own project ideas. A sample project could involve a cellphone robot using
    cloud computing to understand speech, text-to-speech, and web services to play
    a text based adventure game with a human in a more natural way than typing and
    clicking.> Don' forget that Confoo will occur from February 29th to March 2nd
    at [Hilton Bonaventure Hotel](http://confoo.ca/en/hotel). Don't miss your chance
    to socialize with Charles Olivier Nutter (headius - JRuby), Marc-André Lafortune

    I am looking for someone who is ready to put in a minimum of 30 hours/week on
    this project. I also want someone who will stick around and support their own
    code while we beta and then start to add new functions and features. I need a
    creative coder who will help me make decisions and be a part of the entire development
    process, a long-term (paid) partner who is ready to kick some serious ass.\n>
    \n> By the way, I'm a huge fan of 37 Signals and so my goal here is to put out
    1/2 of a product, get feedback, and refine. You're going to love working on this!\n>

    March 3-5 for AngelHack and showing our American friends what the Montreal startup
    scene is made of?\n> \n> Context.IO has been invited to fill a bus with at least
    30 Montreal hackers and bring them down to Boston for a one of the most prolific
    hackathons in North America.\n> \n> [http://angelhack.com/](http://angelhack.com/)
    \r \r WHAT IS ANGELHACK?\r \r AngelHack brings together startup communities from
    around the country for a hackathon competition, judged by top Angel Investors,
    where participants build startup ideas. The only rule is all code must be fresh,
    so that everyone has a fair chance. Build your startup at AngelHack, win prizes,
    national recognition, and validation from Angel Investors on what they think of
    your ideas.\r \r ANGELHACK 2.0\r \r AngelHack 2 focuses on the startup communities
    in Boston and San Francisco and has over $50k in prizes to win. We estimate there
    to be over 600 participants for the March 3-4th event.\r \r If you're interested,
    your registration fee will be waived. There will be a small fee (between $20-$30)
    for the bus rental. Friday night accommodations will also be your responsibility,
    but Context.IO will work to get a great group deal at a hotel nearby. Keep in
    mind that Saturday night would be all hacking, so accommodations will only be
    required on Friday night. We'll ride in Friday evening and take the bus back overnight
    on Sunday. Red eye FTW.\r \r We need 30 hackers to be accepted to sponsor, so
    we'd love you all to come in big numbers.\r \r\n> \n> This is an incredible opportunity
    for the Montreal Startup Scene. Being selected as a finalist or winner at this
    event would mean considerable press and visibility to some of the most high profile
    VCs in North America. Imagine Montreal took everyone by surprise with a win here?
    Let's show them what we're capable of!\n> \n> Brainstorm on the bus, build in
    Boston, be totally awesome. This is not a weekend you should miss. \n> \n> If
    you're willing to commit, please submit your email address via the following form:

    conferences. ConFoo 2013 will be held on February 25 through March 1 in Montreal,

    until September 23. Consult the [call for papers](http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers)

    ConFoo can cover for speakers. You can also get [advice](http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/guidelines)
    on how to write proposals.\r \r The call for papers is public, meaning that all
    proposals get published on the website for others to vote and comment on. This
    approach allows the organizers to pick subjects that have most interest in the
    community. The comments are only visible to speakers and organizers to avoid influencing
    the votes.\r \r To stay in touch via Twitter, follow [@confooca](http://twitter.com/confooca)

  post_content: "This month meet-up will be presented by [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/).
    They are sponsoring the event, and the two speakers work there.\n\n> To start
    the event, [Christian Joudrey](https://twitter.com/cjoudrey) will present [Ruby
    One Time Password](https://github.com/mdp/rotp) library. Following the recent
    Rails vulnerabilities we all know that keeping our dependencies up-to-date is
    important. What is equally important is providing our users with ways of securing
    their accounts. We'll look at how two-factor authentication works, a way of implementing
    it and how to leverage the Google Authenticator mobile app.> Afterward, [Edward
    Ocampo-Gooding](https://twitter.com/edwardog) will talk about [Legato](https://github.com/tpitale/legato)
    - a Google Analytics Reports client written in Ruby. If you need to programmatically
    hit Google Analytics for data coming from reports, you want this. I’ll show you
    how I used it for a project at Shopify and also point out a few bits of internal
    Legato code/architecture that I thought were great examples of idiomatic Ruby.
    Hint: probably some metaprogramming.> This event is sponsored by [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/).
    They'll provide us with food and beers. They'll also be able to answer any of
    your questions about their product.\r \r \r As usual, we are moving to Benelux
    after the event for drinks and great discussions.\r \r \r \r When: March 19th,

    will present Speed Up Your Database. Are your queries slow? Learn how to speed
    them up through better SQL crafting and use meaningful indices. You will understand

    (a \"souper\").\n\n> To start the night, [Guillaume Malette](https://twitter.com/gmalette)
    will present: \"Migrating to an STI with no downtime\". During this talk, Guillaume
    will explain how to do a multi-steps migration so a database table lock won't
    create downtime on your application.> Afterward, [Andy Maleh](https://twitter.com/AndyMaleh)
    will talk about: \"Ultra Light & Maintainable Wizards in Rails\".\r \r \r \r You
    may have learned how to write proper Rails MVC features with skinny controllers
    and fat models. You may have learned how to properly compose your features in
    terms of RESTful resources. But, how do you write a proper easy to maintain Wizard
    without resulting in a fat controller, violating REST, or writing complicated
    Wizard step data management code? Do you use multiple controllers? Multiple actions
    in one controller? A state machine? An existing Wizard gem?\r \r These are all
    questions that will get answered in this talk, in which I plan to share a simple
    Wizard approach that I stumbled upon while working on my last two Rails projects.
    It made it super easy to add Wizard steps by both junior and senior Rails developers
    on the projects.\r \r Attendees should walk out of this talk with solid knowledge
    on how to build a light maintainable Rails Wizard, achieving proper separation
    of responsibilities between controllers and models, and maintaining a RESTful
    paradigm without the complexity of Wizard step management.> Like the past month,
    Shopify is sponsoring beers and pizzas for the event. They are still searching
    developers for their Montreal office, don't miss your chance to [join](http://www.shopify.com/careers)
    a great team.> After the meet-up, Nextly will sponsor a second beer to everyone
    who come. Nextly is a fast-growing, early-stage, VC-funded startup that is rethinking
    the way we organize and consume the web. Nextly is looking for experienced Ruby
    developers to join its Montreal team.\r \r If you're interested, please contact

  post_content: "Ce mois-ci, nous recevons quelqu'un de l'extérieur pour la première
    présentation. François Marier de \"Identity Team\" chez Mozilla fera une pause
    lors de son voyage à Montréal pour venir nous présenter ce sur quoi il travaille.\n\n>
    Le premier talk sera par [François Marier](https://twitter.com/fmarier) - un développeur
    logiciel chez [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/).\r \r \r \r \r \r Les utilisateurs
    haïssent les choisir et devoir s'en rappeler. Les développeurs haïssent devoir
    les gérer et les storer. Pourquoi utilisons-nous des mots de passe déjà? Il y
    a probablement un meilleur moyen pour s'enregistrer sur les sites web.\r \r Cette
    présentation introduira la technologie derrière [Persona](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/)
    et le protocole BrowserID. Mozilla veut résoudre le problème des mots de passe
    sur le web avec une solution multi-browser qui se préoccupe grandement de l'expérience
    utilisateur et leur vie privée.\r \r Nous ne serons peut-être pas capable d'éliminer
    tous les mots de passe. Après tout, vous ne voulez probablement pas devoir faire
    une vérification d'emprunte digitale avant de laisser un commentaire sur un blog,
    mais nous pouvons éliminer les mots de passe par site web en les remplaçant par
    quelque chose de mieux: un système décentralisé sous le contrôle des utilisateurs.\r
    \r Il s'agit de 4 étapes faciles pour l'ajouter à votre site/application Ruby
    et il y a déjà des plugins pour Devise, Omniauth, Rails, Sinatra et Warden.> Le
    deuxième talk par [Hugo Frappier](https://twitter.com/hugofrappier) sera sur [Draper
    gem](https://github.com/drapergem/draper).\r \r \r \r \r \r Que pensez-vous de
    mettre de la logique de vue dans vos modèles? Que pensez-vous de mettre de la
    logique de vue en scope global dans vos helpers? Draper gem propose une solution
    alternative: des décorateurs. Il s'agit d'une couche de présentation orienté-objet
    au dessus de vos modèles.\n* * *\n\r \r \r \r This month, we receive someone who
    lives outside Montreal for the first presentation. François Marier of the \"Identity
    Team\" at Mozilla will take some time during his travel to Montreal to present
    us what he is working on.\r \r \r> The first talk will be by [François Marier](https://twitter.com/fmarier)
    - a software developer at [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/).\r \r \r \r
    \r \r Users hate picking and having to remember them. Developers hate dealing
    with and storing them. Why are we still using passwords again? Surely there is
    a better way to log into websites.\r \r This talk will introduce the technology
    behind [Persona](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/) and the BrowserID protocol.
    Mozilla intends to solve the password problem on the web with a federated cross-browser
    system that is intensely focused on user experience and privacy.\r \r We may not
    be able to get rid of all passwords, after all, you probably don't want to be
    subjected to a fingerprint check before leaving a comment on someone's blog, but
    we can eliminate site-specific passwords and replace them with something better:
    a decentralized system that's under the control of users, not a for-profit gatekeeper.\r
    \r It's just four easy steps to add it to your Ruby site/app from scratch and
    there are already plugins for Devise, Omniauth, Rails, Sinatra, and Warden.> The
    second talk by [Hugo Frappier](https://twitter.com/hugofrappier) will by on [Draper
    gem](https://github.com/drapergem/draper).\r \r \r \r \r \r What do you think
    about view logic in your models? What do you think about global scope view logic
    in your helpers? Draper gem propose a different approach: decorators. They are
    an oriented-object presentation layer over your models.\n* * *\n\n> Like they
    did in the past months, Shopify is sponsoring beers and pizzas for the event.

    chance to [join](http://www.shopify.com/careers) a great team.\r \r \r \r \r This
    month [Gary Haran](https://twitter.com/garyharan) will be your host since I'll

  post_name: september-17th-meet-up
- post_title: September 17th discussion follow-up
  post_content: "Bonjour,\r \r Hier soir au meet-up, nous avons eu une discussion
    à propos du groupe et de ce qui s'y passe. Je vous fait parvenir ce courriel pour
    faire un résumé des actions que je vais mettre en place suite à cette discussion.\r
    \r Premièrement, comme vous pouvez voir, la première partie de ce message est
    écrit en français. Je vais désormais faire les annonces au groupe dans les 2 langues.
    Le but ici est d'encourager les gens avec un peu moins de facilité en anglais
    à venir présenter des sujets ou discuter sur la mailing list.\r \r Deuxièmement,
    j'ai été grandement surpris hier que la mailing list n'était connu que par 50%
    des gens à l'événement. Alors, nous allons encourager les gens à s'inscrire de
    façon à ce qu'il puisse se tenir à jour avec ce qu'il se passe dans le groupe.
    Tant qu'à faire cela, j'ai créé un nouveau groupe avec notre nouveau nom (Montreal.rb).
    Notre nouveau Google Group est: [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/montrealrb](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/montrealrb).
    L'ancien était à l'adresse: [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/montreal-on-rails](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/montreal-on-rails).
    Si vous connaissez quelqu'un qui participe régulièrement ou à l'occasion au groupe,
    invitez cette personne à se joindre à la nouvelle mailing list.\r \r Troisièmement,
    nous allons avoir besoin d'un volontaire à chaque meet-up pour accueillir le gens.
    Le but ici est de bien accueillir les nouveaux participants à nos rencontres.
    En même temps, cette personne pourra inviter les gens à se joindre à la mailing
    list pour suivre le groupe. Selon moi, ce poste serait en rotation à chaque événement,
    je vous invite donc à vous y inscrire - c'est un excellent moyen de rencontrer
    les autres participants.\r \r Quatrièmement, à chaque événement, nous allons réserver
    un talk de 5 minutes pour les personnes qui n'ont jamais parlé à Montreal.rb.
    Les nouveaux-venus auront un moment réservé pour eux. Ils pourront ainsi être
    moins intimidé par une présentation, se faire un peu d'expérience et une présentation
    de 5 minutes demande moins de préparation qu'un talk complet. Les gens seront
    encouragé à présenter un gem, une feature de ruby/RoR qu'ils viennent tout juste
    de découvrir et qu'ils apprécient. Ils pourront également présenter un projet
    qu'ils ont fait avec Ruby/RoR.\r \r Finalement, je vous demande votre aide pour
    m'aider à organiser Montreal.rb. Il est difficile de trouver des talks. Si vous
    avez une idée intéressante et n'avez pas le temps de la présenter, partagez la
    avec le groupe. Quelqu'un d'autre sera peut-être intéressé à présenter le sujet
    qui vous intéresse. Je vais créer une liste sur le site web avec les idées proposées.
    Si vous êtes intéressé à faire un talk dans 1-2-3 mois, faites le moi savoir,
    je réserverai votre place à l'avance.\r \r Pour conclure ce message, je voudrais
    vous rappeler de vous inscrire sur le nouveau Google group: [**https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/montrealrb**](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/montrealrb).\r
    \r On se voit sur la nouvelle mailing list.\n\n* * *\n\r \r Hi,\r \r At the meet-up
    yesterday, we had a discussion about the groupe and what's going on with it. This
    email we summarize the actions that I'll take following this discussion.\r \r
    First of all, as you can see, the first part of this email is in french. From
    now on, I'll do the post to the group in both languages. The goal is to encourage
    people which are not fluant in english to come do a talk or share on the mailing
    list.\r \r Afterward, I was really surprised that only 50% of people present yesterday
    know about the Montreal.rb mailing list. We'll do some shmoozing so people can
    know about it and register. By doing that, I created a new mailing list which
    as our new name: The new Google group is: [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/montrealrb](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/montrealrb)
    - the old one was: [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/montreal-on-rails](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/montreal-on-rails).
    Please share the new mailing list address with people who are participating to
    Montreal.rb that you know.\r \r Then, we'll need a volunteer at each meet-up to
    welcome people. The goal is to be welcoming to new participants et invite people
    to register on the Google group. I think this position should be in rotation at
    every meet-up. You should register now to do it - it's a great way to meet the
    other participants.\r \r A each meet-up, we reserve a 5 minutes talk for participant
    who never talk to Montreal.rb. The newcomers will have a spot were is less stressful,
    less intimidating and require less work than a full blown talk. They can talk
    about a gem or a feature un Ruby/RoR they just discover and like. They can also
    talk about a project they did with Ruby/RoR.\r \r Finally, I need your help to
    organize Montreal.rb. It's really hard to find talks for the meet-ups. I you have
    an idea for a talk but you don't have time to present it, please share it with
    the group. Someone else could be interested in presenting it. I'll create a list
    on the web site to list those ideas. At the same time, if you are interested in
    doing a talk in 1-2-3 months, contact me, I'll reserve you a spot in advance.\r

  post_content: "Le mois de Novembre est arrivé avec le froid et le vent. Alors, pourquoi
    ne pas venir à la maison Notman le 19 novembre pour se réchauffer, boire quelques
    bières, manger de la pizza et écouter des présentations vraiment intéressantes?\n\n>
    Pour commencer la soirée, [Jean Boussier](https://github.com/byroot) va présenter
    [ActiveRecord::TypedStore](https://github.com/byroot/activerecord-typedstore),
    un gem qu'il a écrit en travaillant chez Shopify.\r \r Au cours de sa présentation,
    Jean nous parlera des fonctionnalités de sérialisation de ActiveRecord à travers
    l'histoire de Ruby on Rails (serialize, store). Il nous démontrera les limitations
    de ces approches et pourquoi vous devriez essayer ActiveRecord::TypedStore. Il
    nous montrera également comment utiliser cette extension à ActiveRecord.> Par
    la suite, [Martin Provencher](https://twitter.com/vivrass) montrera une étude
    de cas sur Rails et [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org/).\r \r Pourquoi devriez-vous
    utiliser Angular.js? Quand devriez-vous l'utiliser? Comment fonctionne-t-il? Comment
    l'intégrer avec Ruby on Rails? Ce sont toutes des questions auxquelles Martin
    répondra pendant sa présentation. Au coeur de cette présentation, il y a une application
    qu'il a construit. Vous verrez un exemple réel sur comment faire fonctionner ces
    2 frameworks ensemble.> Shopify continue de commanditer Montreal.rb comme dans
    les derniers mois. Ils paieront pour la pizza et la bière lors de l'évènement.
    Ils cherchent toujours des développeurs pour leur bureau de Montréal, ne ratez
    pas votre chance de [joindre](http://www.shopify.com/careers) cette brillante
    équipe.\r \r \r J'espère vous voir en grand nombre à Montreal.rb demain. Comme
    d'habitude, nous finissons le tout au Benelux pour continuer les discussions.\r
    \r \r \r\n* * *\n\r \r \r \r November is here with the cold and the wind. So,
    why not come to Notman House on November 19th to warm-up, drink some beers, eat
    pizza, and listen to very interesting talks?\r \r \r> To start the night, [Jean
    Boussier](https://github.com/byroot) will present [ActiveRecord::TypedStore](https://github.com/byroot/activerecord-typedstore),
    a gem he wrote while working at Shopify.\r \r \r \r During this talk, Jean will
    review ActiveRecord serialization features through rails history (serialize, store).
    He'll show the limitations of those approaches and why you should try ActiveRecord::TypedStore.
    He'll also demonstrate how to use this ActiveRecord extension.> Afterward, [Martin
    Provencher](https://twitter.com/vivrass) will demonstrate a study case of Rails
    and [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org/).\r \r \r \r Why should you use Angular.js?
    When should you use it? How does it works? How can I integrate it with Ruby on
    Rails? This is all the questions Martin will answer during his talk. At the heart
    of this presentation is an application Martin built. You'll have a real example
    on how you can make those 2 frameworks work together.> Like they did in the past
    months, Shopify is sponsoring beers and pizzas for the event. They are still searching
    developers for their Montreal office; don't miss your chance to [join](http://www.shopify.com/careers)
    a great team.\r \r \r I look forward to see you tomorrow. As usual, we'll finish
    everything at Benelux to continue the conversations.\r \r \r \r When: October

  post_content: "Le temps des fêtes est terminé. J'espère que vous avez passez un
    bon moment avec vos familles. Je vous souhaite à tous une excellente année rempli
    de santé et de défis.\r \r Pour débuter cette année 2014, nous nous tiendrons
    loin de Rails en discutant de scripting en Ruby et de gestion de projet.\n\n>
    La soirée commencera avec [David Lazar](http://resistorsoftware.com/). Programmeur
    depuis 1978, il a développé avec plusieurs micro-processeur (Z80, 8080, 6502,
    8088, 6800, 68000) et ordinateurs (Amiga, TRS-80, Apple II, Sun workstation, PC,
    Apple MBP). Ses langages préférés sont Ruby et Javascript.\r \r Ruby est un langage
    de scripting idéal pour travailler avec le monde d'API d'aujourd'hui: PaaS, SaaS,
    Web Apps, sans oublier les services old-school. Il vous montrera quelques trucs
    utiles et des cas d'utilisations que j'ai bâtit lors des 8 dernières années avec
    Shopify, Heroku, Salesforce et d'autres systèmes. Les gems comme Pry, Nokogiri,
    Sinatra, Ice Cube, Dalli, Chronic, Fog, Carrierwave, HTTParty seront bien utiles.\r
    \r Ce tour rapide de 20 minutes sur des scripts relativement complexes avec Ruby
    pourra, il l'espère, inspirer quelques Rubyists à pousser leurs talents de scripting
    un peu plus loin et dans une différente direction que Rails.> La deuxième présentation
    sera par [Yann Larrivée](http://www.ylarrivee.com/). Yann est le président de
    PHP Québec, Confoo et FooLab inc. Il est impliqué dans la communauté depuis très
    longtemps. Il écrit actuellement un livre intitulé: “_10 Warning Signs in IT Projects_”.\r
    \r C'est un fait que les projets en IT ont un haut pourcentage d'échec. Mais qu'arriverait-il
    si nous pouvions voir les avertissements avant qu'il ne soit trop tard? Découvrez
    les 10 signes à superviser et évitez ces nuits blanches et ces échecs de projets.>
    Comme ils ont fait les derniers mois, Shopify commanditera la bière et la pizza
    pour l'évènement. Ils [cherchent](http://www.shopify.com/careers) des développeurs
    pour leur bureau à Montréal.\r \r \r \r \r Comme d'habitude, nous continuerons
    la soirée au Benelux. Au plaisir de vous voir à notre premier évènement de 2014.\r
    \r \r \r \r \r\n* * *\n\r \r \r \r The Holidays are over. I hope you had a good
    time with your family. I wish you all health and fun challenges for 2014.\r \r
    To start this year, we will keep our distance with Rails to talk about Ruby scripting
    and project management.\r \r \r> Everything will start with [David Lazar](http://resistorsoftware.com/).
    Programming since 1978, he hacked with multiple chips (Z80, 8080, 6502, 8088,
    6800, 68000) and computers (Amiga, TRS-80, Apple II, Sun workstation, PC, Apple
    MBP). His favorite programming languages are Ruby and Javascript.\r\n> Ruby is
    a great scripting language for working in the API driven world of today's PaaS,
    SaaS, Web Apps, and old-school services. David would like to show off some neat
    and interesting business use cases, built in the last 8 years or so between Shopify,
    Heroku, Salesforce, and other systems. Ruby gems like Pry, Nokogiri, Sinatra,
    Ice Cube, Dalli, Chronic, Fog, Carrierwave, HTTParty are in common and see a lot
    of use.\n> \n> A quick 20 minute spin through a reasonably complex pattern of
    scripts with Ruby that can hopefully inspire some Rubyists to take their scripting
    talents a little further and in a different direction than Rails.> The second
    presentation will be by [Yann Larrivée](http://www.ylarrivee.com/). Yann is the
    president of PHP Québec, Confoo, and FooLab inc. He is involved in the community
    since a really long time. He is writing a book called: “_10 Warning Signs in IT
    Projects_”.\r \r It is know that in the IT industry, projects have a high percentage
    of failures. But what if we could see the warning signs before it is too late?
    Discover the 10 warning signs to watch for and prevent many sleepless nights and
    project failure.> Like they did in the past months, Shopify is sponsoring beers
    and pizzas for the event. They are still [searching](http://www.shopify.com/careers)

    modélisation d'objet s'apprend et s'enseigne. Cette présentation démontrera les
    cinq compétences essentielles nécessaire pour modéliser des objets et leurs responsabilités.
    Pensez au-delà d'ActiveRecord et de votre base de donnée, apprenez comment les
    couleurs et les patterns vont vous aider à expliquer, entretenir et étendre votre

    have struggled with identifying domain objects. Assigning business rules and services
    appears to be a talent that only other developers are born with. Fear not! Object
    Modeling is a learnable, teachable skill. This talk demonstrates the five essential
    skills you need for modeling objects and their responsibilities. Think beyond
    ActiveRecord and your database, and learn how color and patterns will help you
    explain, maintain and extend your application.\n\n> The second talk will be by
    [Jean Boussier](https://github.com/byroot). He's going to talk about a Rails problem
    he faced while working at Shopify\r\n> **Debugging Counter Cache**\n> \n> Do you
    use Rails counter caches? Did you ever notice a counter that was incorrect? Did
    you wonder what happened? In this interactive debugging session, we'll dig into
    Rails internals to understand how cache counters works, and how they can be corrupted.

    \r \r Combien de fois vous êtes-vous retrouvés près de la ligne d’arrivée de la
    mise en prod d’un nouveau feature excitant, mais retirés à la dernière minute
    par les gestionnaires pour régler des problèmes plus urgents? Que faites-vous
    avec le code incomplet de votre feature si une bonne part est fonctionnelle et
    déjà intégrée dans Master? Faut-il l’extraire dans une branche à part? Faut-il
    commenter le code qui n’est pas prêt à être exposé au client? Et qui faire des
    améliorations de design, amenés par le nouveau feature qui sont déjà utiles à
    l’équipe aujourd’hui? Est-ce qu’on laisse les améliorations de design sur la glace
    jusqu’à ce que le feature reviennent en priorité?\r \r Ces décisions sont généralement
    prises par l’équipe au cas par cas et viennent souvent avec des gros compromis
    sur la qualité et sur la livraison.\r \r Consultant pour Sears en 2009 et travaillant
    chez Groupon.com en 2012, j'ai travaillé dans des équipe qui ont adoptés une solution
    efficace et peu couteuse au problème appelée \"_Branch by Abstraction_\", une
    technique popularisée par Martin Fowler, auteur de _UML Distilled and Patterns
    of Enterprise Application Architecture_.\r \r Dans cette présentation, je vais
    expliquer _Branch by Abstraction_ et démontrer comment l'appliquer à Ruby en utilisant
    un gem que j'ai créé appelé _Abstract Feature Branch_, partiellement inspiré par
    les librairies internes utilisées par Sears et Groupon. Ce gem a au dessus de
    50000 téléchargements sur rubygems.org et a été utilisé dans une multitude de
    mes projets, incluant le lancement de EarlyShares.com et l'amélioration de Factor75.com.\r
    \r À la fin de la présentation, l'audience aura une compréhension de base des
    concepts de _Branch by Abstraction_ et suffisamment de connaissances de _Abstract
    Feature Branch_ pour être en mesure d'explorer le concept dans ses propres projets.\r

    Feature Branch** by [Andy Maleh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andymaleh)\n> \n>
    \r \r How many times do you find yourself near the software release finish line
    on an exciting new feature only to be pulled off by management in the last minute
    to sneak in some higher priority emergency fix? What do you do with the unfinished
    feature's code if parts of it were already functional and merged into master?
    Do you pluck it out and move to a remote feature branch? Do you simply comment
    out the code not ready for exposure to the customer? What about some of the nice
    software design improvements that were done as part of the feature and are being
    put to good use by the team today? Do you also put design improvements off till
    the feature is deemed by management high priority again?\r \r These questions
    typically get decided on by the team on a case by case basis, and often with big
    compromises affecting both project delivery and code quality.\r \r While consulting
    for Sears in 2009 and working at Groupon.com in 2012, I happened to work in teams
    that adopted a very effective and inexpensive solution to the problem called \"_Branch
    by Abstraction_\", a technique originally popularized by Martin Fowler, author
    of _UML Distilled and Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture_.\r \r In
    this talk, I aim to explain _Branch by Abstraction_ and demonstrate how to apply
    in Ruby using a gem I wrote called _Abstract Feature Branch_, partly inspired
    by the internal team libraries used at Sears and Groupon. The gem has already
    had over 50,000 downloads from rubygem.org and has been utilized in several of
    my newer projects, including launch of EarlyShares.com and enhancements of Factor75.com.\r
    \r Attendees should walk out with basic understanding of _Branch by Abstraction_
    and enough knowledge of _Abstract Feature Branch_ to be able to explore further
    in their own projects after the talk.\r \r \r As usual, you're all invited for

    Riak is a NoSQL datastore built to run as a highly fault-tolerant distributed
    cluster. The idea behind Riak is that you can literally set a node on fire and
    the cluster will be able to function reliably while you sleep on, and bounce back
    to normal when the node is replaced. This presentation will go over Riak's approach
    to replication and scaling, covering a tiny bit of distributed systems theory
    in the process. We will also go over Riak's consistency configurations and the
    mathemagically conflict-free CRDT datatypes and how you can create sensible data
    models for your application while making the most of these options.\r \r \r As

  post_content: "Hey fellow Rubyist,\r \r Yesterday was my last meet-up as a Montreal.rb
    organizer. After 4.5 years of taking care of our group, it’s time for me to pass
    the torch.\r \r I remember so much from all the time I spent volunteering for
    Montreal.rb. The group grew during my tenure and we frequently had new faces,
    an achievement that I’m really proud of. We also had great projects like Railsbridge
    and Office Hours. Those are proof of our dynamic community here in Montreal. I
    would like to thank everyone who attended one of our events, those who spent time
    helping me organize Montreal.rb, and especially those who had the courage to give
    a talk.\r \r Does that mean that Montreal.rb will die? I don’t think so. I’m leaving
    because I believe our community is ready to grow without me supporting it on my
    shoulders. I’ll be honest here: organizing Montreal.rb takes a lot more time than
    what you would think. If you like our group and you want to see it survive, please
    get involved. Do not let only one person be responsible for our group, it’s really
    hard to do. You don’t need to spend as much time as I did - organizing 1 meet-up
    here and there is enough to help the organizers.\r \r What is next for me? Where
    will I get involved next? Honestly, I don’t know. I’m working and having fun at
    Sharethebus – we are hiring btw :) – that’s a start. I’ll maybe have time to do
    some open source, who knows?\r \r Anyhow, I’ll see you at the next Montreal.rb
    meet-up where I’ll be only an attendee – a first since 2011.\r \r \r \r Take care
    of our group for me,\r \r Martin\n\n"

    2 langages fonctionnels: Elixir et Haskell. Est-ce que votre style Ruby changera

    \r \r\n> **Comment Elixir transforme ma pensée**\n> \r Au cours des dernières
    années, j'ai joué avec la programmation fonctionnelle, mais rien ne semblait coller
    jusqu'à ce que je commence avec Elixir. Dans cette présentation, je partagerai
    mon histoire de comment Elixir a transformé mon modèle de programmation en utilisant
    le pattern matching, les pipelines et les messaging-passing processes. Attention,
    peut-être la même chose vous arrivera!> Par la suite, , [Christian Lavoie](https://twitter.com/christianlav)

    my Mind**\n> \r Over the last couple of years I've dabbled with functional programming,
    but nothing seemed to stick. Until I started with Elixir. In this presentation,
    I will share my personal story on how Elixir has transformed my model of programming
    using pattern matching, pipelines and messaging-passing processes. Beware, perhaps
    your mind will be transformed too!> Afterward, [Christian Lavoie](https://twitter.com/christianlav)
